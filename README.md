---

This repository accompanies **Lucia Martina Scalise’s PhD thesis in Biological Anthropology**, titled  
**_“Unravelling cremation: a multi-analytical approach to the study of Bronze Age cremated human remains”_**  
(**University of Cambridge, 2025**), supervised by **Dr. Emma Pomeroy**.

The repository contains data files, scripts, and outputs supporting **Chapters 4, 5, and 6** of the thesis.  
Materials related to **Chapter 3** are available separately on Zenodo:

## 📘 Thesis Overview

The study integrates virtual imaging, physical excavation, osteological, taphonomic, and proteomic approaches to explore **mortuary behaviour** and **biological profiles** with the aim to improve the quality and quantity of information that can be obtained from the study of cremated remains.
**Temporal & cultural context:** Burials date to the **Middle–Recent Bronze Age (ca. 1450–1150 BCE)** and belong to the **Terramare culture (Northern Italy)**.

Analyses were conducted on:
- **12 urns from the Vicofertile necropolis (Parma)**  
- **5 urns from the Nogarole Rocca necropolis (Verona)**  

The research applies a **multi-proxy analytical framework** combining:

- 🧱 **Virtual analysis** of urns and contents through **CT imaging**
- 🦴 **Physical micro-excavation** of cremated remains
- 👩‍🔬 **Assessment of biological profiles** (sex, age-at-death, pathology)
- 🔥 **Evaluation of heat-induced changes** (e.g. colour, fracture patterns, fragmentation)
- 🧭 **Spatial distribution** of bones inside urns to assess possible **intentionality**
- 🧬 **Proteomic analyses** (amelogenin & ZooMS) for **sex and species identification**
- 📊 **Statistical modelling** to integrate and test quantitative evidence

## 🧭 Chapter Overview

### **Chapter 3**
Presents a **virtual approach** to urned cremations using **CT-based qualitative and quantitative analysis** and **permutation testing**.  
The corresponding dataset and code are available on Zenodo:  
👉 [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15042290](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15042290)

### **Chapter 4**
Focuses on the **micro-excavation** and **osteological analysis** of cremated remains to assess the biological profile of the individuals

### **Chapter 5**
Explores **heat-induced changes** and **bone distribution** to infer **cremation practices** and **possible ritual intent**.  
Includes:
- Analysis of **colour variations**, **fracture morphology**, and calculation of the **fragmentation index**
- Application of **mosaic plots** to test associations among variables

### **Chapter 6**
Presents **proteomic analyses**:
- **Amelogenin-based sex estimation** from 11 tooth crowns  
- **ZooMS identification** on one burned and one unburned bone fragment
