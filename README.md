## 📘 Thesis Overview

This thesis investigates the **Middle to Recent Bronze Age (ca. 1450–1150 BCE)** in **Northern Italy**, focusing on cremated human remains from the **Terramare Culture**.  
The study integrates virtual imaging, physical excavation, osteological, taphonomic, and proteomic approaches to explore **mortuary behaviour**, **biological profiles**, and **funerary variability**.

Analyses were conducted on:
- **12 urns from the Vicofertile necropolis (Parma)**  
- **5 urns from the Nogarole Rocca necropolis (Verona)**  

The research applies a **multi-proxy analytical framework** combining:

- 🧱 **Virtual analysis** of urns and contents through **CT imaging**
- 🦴 **Physical micro-excavation** and **osteological study** of cremated remains
- 👩‍🔬 **Assessment of biological profiles** (sex, age-at-death, pathology)
- 🔥 **Evaluation of heat-induced changes** (colour, fracture patterns, fragmentation)
- 🧭 **Spatial distribution** of bones inside urns to assess possible **intentionality**
- 🧬 **Proteomic analyses** (amelogenin & ZooMS) for **sex and species identification**
- 📊 **Statistical modelling** to integrate and test quantitative evidence
